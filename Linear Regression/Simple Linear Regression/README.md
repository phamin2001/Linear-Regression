# 🚗 Simple Linear Regression Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles based on their characteristics. The analysis uses a fuel consumption dataset to explore relationships between vehicle features and their environmental impact.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`
- **Description**: Contains vehicle specifications and their corresponding CO2 emissions
- **Key Features**:
  - `ENGINESIZE`: Engine displacement in liters
  - `CYLINDERS`: Number of engine cylinders
  - `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB`: Combined fuel consumption (L/100km)
  - `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG`: Combined fuel consumption in MPG
  - `CO2EMISSIONS`: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer (target variable)

## 🔬 Analysis Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- **Data Loading**: Import and examine the dataset structure
- **Statistical Summary**: Understand data distribution and characteristics
- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant variables for regression analysis

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms showing feature distributions
- **Relationship Analysis**: Scatter plots revealing correlations between features and CO2 emissions
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Strong positive correlation between engine size and emissions
  - Linear relationship between fuel consumption and emissions
  - Number of cylinders also correlates with emissions

### 3️⃣ Model Development
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepare data for machine learning
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing with reproducible random state
- **Model Training**: Linear regression using scikit-learn
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate different features as predictors

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - 📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - 📉 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - 📈 R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- **Model Comparison**: Engine Size vs Fuel Consumption as predictors

## 🏆 Key Results

### Engine Size Model
- **Linear Equation**: CO2 = [coefficient] × Engine Size + [intercept]
- **Interpretation**: For each liter increase in engine size, CO2 emissions increase by approximately [coefficient] g/km
- **R² Score**: Model explains approximately [X]% of variance in emissions

### Fuel Consumption Model
- **Performance**: Generally provides better predictions than engine size alone
- **Business Value**: More practical for real-world applications since fuel consumption is easier to measure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib`: Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and metrics

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis
1. 📥 Clone or download the project files
2. 📄 Ensure the dataset `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv` is in the same directory
3. 🚀 Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook simple_linear_regression.ipynb
   ```
4. ▶️ Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## 📊 Key Findings

### Statistical Insights
- **Linear Relationships**: Both engine size and fuel consumption demonstrate strong linear relationships with CO2 emissions
- **Predictive Power**: The models provide reasonable accuracy for emission predictions
- **Feature Comparison**: Fuel consumption typically outperforms engine size as a predictor

### Business Applications
- **Vehicle Assessment**: Estimate environmental impact of vehicles before purchase
- **Policy Making**: Support emission regulations and standards
- **Automotive Industry**: Guide design decisions for more efficient vehicles

## ⚠️ Model Limitations
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Assumes linear relationships only
- **Single Feature**: Uses only one predictor at a time
- **Data Scope**: Limited to the vehicles in the dataset

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Combine multiple features for better predictions
- **Polynomial Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships
- **Additional Features**: Include vehicle weight, transmission type, fuel type
- **Advanced Models**: Explore ensemble methods or neural networks
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold validation for robust model evaluation
