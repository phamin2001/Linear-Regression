# 📊 Linear Regression Project

## 📝 Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various regression techniques, starting with **Simple Linear Regression** and expanding to **Multiple Linear Regression** and beyond. The goal is to analyze and predict CO2 emissions from vehicles based on their characteristics using machine learning models.

## 🔬 Current Progress
### Simple Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Predict CO2 emissions using a single feature (e.g., engine size or fuel consumption).
- **Status**: Completed.
- **Key Results**:
  - Strong linear relationships identified between features and CO2 emissions.
  - Models provide reasonable accuracy for predictions.

### Multiple Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Use multiple features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Status**: Planned for development.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Combine multiple features for better predictions.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Add new features like vehicle weight, transmission type, and fuel type.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore ensemble methods or neural networks.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold validation for robust model evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib`: Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and metrics
